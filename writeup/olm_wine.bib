Abstract = {The article comments on electronically connected freelancers called e-lancers joined together into fluid and temporary networks to produce and sell goods and services and their effect on business and the economy. Trends brought about by the e-lance economy point to the devolution of large, permanent corporations into flexible, temporary networks of individuals. Research suggests that when it is cheaper to conduct transactions internally, organizations grow larger, but when it is cheaper to conduct them externally, with independent entities in the open market, organizations stay small or shrink. },
